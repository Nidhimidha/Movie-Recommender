Blockbuster or art film?
==============================

1. Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub
account
2. Download the one of the MovieLens datasets from
https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
3. Load the data set into panda data frames
4. Formulate one or two ideas on how the combination of ratings and tags by
users helps the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data
analysis
5. Build one or more clustering models to determine similar movies to
recommend using the other ratings and tags of movies by other users as
features
6. Document your process and results
